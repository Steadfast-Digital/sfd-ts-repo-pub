# Coding Standards for Our TypeScript/React Monorepo

## Introduction

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for our TypeScript and React monorepo. Our project may incorporate Next.js and supports multiple database systems. Adhering to these guidelines ensures maintainability, scalability, and consistency across the codebase.

## TypeScript Standards

### General Practices

- **Type Safety:** Leverage TypeScript's type system for all variables, return types, and parameters.
- **Interfaces vs Types:** Use `interface` for defining object shapes. Use `type` for more complex type manipulations like unions or intersections.
- **Enums:** Use `enum` for sets of named constants to enhance code readability and maintainability.

### Style Guide

- **Naming Conventions:**
  - Variables and functions: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
  - Interfaces and Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Enums: `PascalCase`
- **File Naming:**
  - React components: `[ComponentName].tsx`
  - Utility files and hooks: `[useUtilityName].ts`

### Linting

- Use ESLint configured with the TypeScript plugin.
- Enforce linting rules on pre-commit using tools like Husky.

## React and Next.js Practices

### Component Design

- **Functional Components:** Use functional components with hooks for state management.
- **File Structure:** Organize components into folders that represent features or domains.
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks should be used to abstract component logic and enhance reusability.

### State Management

- Prefer local state management with Context API for global states, unless the project complexity necessitates something like Redux or MobX.

### Routing and SSR

- **Next.js:** Utilize file-based routing and optimize pages using static generation (`getStaticProps`) or server-side rendering (`getServerSideProps`) as required.

## Database Interaction

### General Practices

- **Database Abstraction:** Use an ORM like Prisma or TypeORM for database interactions to simplify migrations and queries.
- **Multiple Database Support:** Abstract database access through a repository layer to switch easily between different databases.

### Security

- **Input Validation:** Validate inputs at the edge of the system, ideally in API request handlers.
- **Query Security:** Use prepared statements or ORM-provided methods to prevent SQL injection.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Use Jest for unit testing. Each component and utility should have associated tests.
- **Integration Tests:** Use tools like React Testing Library for integration testing of components.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Utilize Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing of the application.

## CI/CD

- **Continuous Integration:** Set up CI workflows using GitHub Actions or Jenkins to run tests and linters on every push.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Automate deployments using tools like Vercel (for Next.js) or other cloud providers based on the project needs.

## Documentation

- Document all public APIs and critical internal mechanisms.
- Use JSDoc for inline documentation and maintain a README file with setup and configuration instructions.
