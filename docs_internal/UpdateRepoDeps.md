# Automating Dependency Updates with Nx

This guide will help you automate the process of updating dependencies in your Nx workspace using Nx migration commands.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the official Nx documentation [here](https://nx.dev/features/automate-updating-dependencies).

## Steps to Update Dependencies

To update your dependencies to their latest versions, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Nx Migrate Command**

   The `nx migrate latest` command updates your workspace to the latest version of Nx, as well as any other dependencies managed by Nx.

   ```bash
   npx nx migrate latest
   ```

2. **Execute Migrations**

   After running the migration command, Nx will generate a `migrations.json` file that contains the necessary migrations to bring your workspace up to date. To execute these migrations, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx nx migrate --run-migrations
   ```

## Summary

By running these commands, you can easily keep your workspace dependencies up to date, ensuring that you are always using the latest versions with all the improvements and security patches.
